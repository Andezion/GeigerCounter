# drunk_app

An atmospheric Flutter app inspired by the aesthetic of "xanax and beer": quiet, sleepy evenings and small moments of pause. This project is an artistic experiment — not medical advice, endorsement, or encouragement of substance use.

## General Info

`drunk_app` is a minimalist experience-focused application that aims to create a gentle, contemplative mood through sound, visuals, and simple interactions. The app provides brief ambient audio, soft visual indicators, and a simple pause/timer feature to help you slow down for a few minutes.

Key ideas:

- Quiet, minimal UI
- Ambient audio and subtle animations
- Short, calming interaction loops

Important safety note: mixing alcohol with prescription medications (including benzodiazepines) can be dangerous or fatal. This project is purely artistic. If you have medical questions or concerns, consult a qualified healthcare professional.

## Demonstration

## Technologies

- Flutter (Dart)

- Save simple session history or mood notes (local-only)
- Refine UI animations and accessibility options
- Localization and theming
